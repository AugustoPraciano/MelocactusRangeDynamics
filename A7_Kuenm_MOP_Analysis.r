# Installing and loading packages
#Installing the package
# The kuenm R package is in a GitHub repository and can be installed and/or loaded using
# the following code (make sure to have Internet connection). To warranty the package 
# functionality, a crucial requirement is to have the maxent.jar application in any 
# user-defined directory (we encourage you to maintain it in a fixed directory). 
# This software is available in the Maxent repository. Another important requirement 
# for using Maxent and therefore the kuenm package is to have the Java Development Kit 
# installed. The Java Development Kit is available in this repository. Finally, for 
# Windows users, Rtools needs to be installed in the computer; it is important that this
# software is added to the PATH. For instructions on how to download and install it see 
# https://github.com/marlonecobos/kuenm.
